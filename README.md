# Bootstrap Documentation - bootstrap-docs

This extension allows the user to search the bootstrap documentation quickly from inside vscode. The official bootstrap documentation is opened after the search.

## Features

By using the command pallete (`ctrl + shift + p`), you can search the official bootstrap documentation without leaving vscode! After the search, the extension will open the official bootstrap docs.

## Known issues

This is more an annoyance than an issue, but if you receive a popup that asks if you want to open the webpage, you can allow the domain to always open.

To allow the domain, click `configure trusted domains` and then click `trust https://getboostrap.com`.

Then vscode will not ask if the page can be opened.
